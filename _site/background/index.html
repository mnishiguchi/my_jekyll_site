    <article><h2 class="post-title">Background</h2>
<div class="post-content"><p>
  I plan to leverage my diverse skills and experiences in the areas of
  linguistics, counseling, customer service, engineering sales, etc
  to become a resourceful and unique developer.
</p>

<h3 class="page_header">
  Linguistics
</h3>
<p>
  At
  <a href="http://www.aasa.ac.jp/">
    Aichi Shukutoku University
  </a>
  in Japan, I majored in Linguistics, with a specialization in Syntax.

  Syntactical analysis is performed in our natural languages when we analyze
  each part of the sentence and how it functions within the sentence.
  Computer language does a similar thing via lexical analysis.

  Because both syntactical analysis and lexical analysis are similar,
  understanding how natural languages work is useful in understanding
  computer languages.
</p>

<h3>
  Counseling
</h3>
<p>
  At
  <a href="http://www.wintec.ac.nz/">
    Waikato Institute of Technology
  </a>
  in New Zealand, I obtained a certificate in Counseling.
  As part of my Counseling major, I assisted young people experiencing
  difficulties with empowerment, coping and self-care to identify best
  solutions for moving forward and progressing in life.

  Counseling skills can be useful in programming when working with clients
  to assist them in identifying their programming needs and collaboratively
  working with the clients to deliver a quality and meaningful product.
</p>

<h3>
  Sales and engineering
</h3>
<p>
  Because of my desire to use my counseling skills to work in sales and
  my burgeoning interest in technology, I sought and landed a job as a
  salesperson with
  <a href="http://www.estic.co.jp/en/index.html">
    ESTIC
  </a>,
  an industrial machinary corporation in central Japan. In this role, I promoted
  <a href="http://www.estic.co.jp/products/product_en.php#Handheld Nutrunner">
    hand-held, high-precision nutrunner systems
  </a>
  to Japan's top auto-makers, including Toyota and Honda.
  I acquired not only sales and customer service skills,
  but also some insight into mechanical and software engineering through
  working with clients and in-house engineers.
</p>

<h3>
  Computer programming
</h3>
<p>
  Shortly after moving to the United States, I met a professional programmer
  at a rock climbing gym. His passion for coding inspired me to research the
  field.

  I not only realized that programming was the career field
  that I was interested in pursuing, but also realized that my past education
  and job experiences were, in a sense, bread crumbs leading to a career in programming.

  Without hesitation, I enrolled in a Computer Science program at
  <a href="http://www.udc.edu/">
    University of the District of Columbia
  </a>.
