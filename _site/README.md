## Troubleshooting

### [Jekyll choking on something when running the Jekyll site locally](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/3103)

```
gem cleanup
bundle exec jekyll serve here
```

### [Jekyll serve didnt work: It looks like you don't have pygments or one of its dependencies installed](http://stackoverflow.com/a/33440992/3837223)

```rb
# Gemfile
gem 'pygments.rb'
```
